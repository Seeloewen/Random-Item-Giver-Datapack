# Compatibility
This file contains a list of all MC Versions and the latest datapack version that works on it. Please note that this file might not alway be up-to-date for newer versions, especially if there are many beta releases. For versions that are still in support, you should always use the latest datapack available for that version.
Snapshots of older versions are not listed, but there's generally only one version compatible with each snapshot. You can find them in the builds folder.
