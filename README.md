# Random Item Giver Datapack

![GitHub all releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/Seeloewen/Random-Item-Giver-Datapack/total?style=for-the-badge)

With the Random Item Giver Datapack you can get a random item every x seconds. You can modify the timer and also which types of items you want to get! There's also a bunch of other customization options, like a message, scoreboard, sounds and much more!
You can access all the ingame menus and settings for the datapack using **/function randomitemgiver:menus/menu**. This menu also pops up when you do /reload.

This datapack is an updated version of Phoenix SC's original version which was only available for 1.14.4, so make sure to check him out on here: **https://www.youtube.com/c/PhnixhamstaSC** .\
Many thanks to him for allowing me to update and share his datapack.

## FAQ

**Q**: I want to use another version of the Datapack. Where can I find it?\
**A**: You can find other versions, like older versions or modified versions in the Builds folder in this GitHub repository.

**Q**: Can I upload a video in which I use this datapack?\
**A**: Yes, you can. You can also put a link to the datapack in the video description, that would be a great way to support me!

**Q**: How can I use this datapack on a server?\
**A**: Installing the datapack on a server is actually quite simple. Open up the server directory > 'world' > 'datapacks' and paste the datapack zip file in there.

**Q**: What items are you able to get?\
**A**: Every single one in the game as of 1.21.5.

**Q**: How can I change the item timer?\
**A**: You can change the rate at which items are given to you in the settings menu of the datapack (**/function randomitemgiver:menus/settings**)

**Q**: What versions of Minecraft is the datapack available for?\
**A**: A list of all versions can be found in Security.MD

**Q**: How can I add new items to the datapack?\
**A**: If you want to add new items to the datapack, you need the full ID of these items. There are some mods out there that can help you do that. If you have the list, you can either use my Random Item Giver Software to add the items or edit the code manually. The Random Item Giver Updater can be found here: https://github.com/Seeloewen/Random-Item-Giver-Updater

**Q**: I see menus and messages of the datapack appearing but don’t get any items!\
**A**: If some components of the datapack are working but you don’t get any items, then it’s most likely a version issue. Make sure the version of your game matches the version the datapack was made for.

**Please note that I most likely won't backport the datapack to older versions as it utilises a lot of 1.16+ features and porting them into an older version is really time consuming and would need a lot of modifications.**

## Downloads

If you want to download the latest versions of the datapack, I recommend going to 'Releases' and getting the newest download available for your desired version.\
In case you need an older download, you might have better luck finding it in the 'Builds' folder. Besides containing all of the latest downloads, there is also a folder for versions prior to 2022.

## Credits
Once again special thanks to Phoenix SC for allowing me to continue working on this project and sharing it. Without him, this datapack wouldn't have been possible. (**https://www.youtube.com/c/PhnixhamstaSC**)

Older versions of this datapack also use the Random Number Generator by CloudWolf. (**https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZnBqVITQ0dloqUU0fGxY3g**)

You can find a list of all the amazing people who helped me by contributing to the pack in the CREDITS.txt in the root folder of the datapacks for the different versions (not the root of the repository!) and in older versions through the ingame menu.

**Important Note: I am not responsible for anything that breaks when using this pack. If something goes wrong, you can open an issue and I'll try to help. If you use this pack in your one of your maps or projects, then please credit me.**
