With the Random Item Giver Datapack you can get a random item every x seconds. You can modify the time when you get an item and also which types of items you want to get!
This datapack is an updated version of Phoenix SC's original version, so make sure to check him out here:

This datapack is really simple, but I hope you like it!
You can update it yourself and edit the code. I will try to update this datapack for every stable minecraft version and maybe some snapshots.

If you have any questions, check the FAQ or open a new issue. It usally doesn't take long for me to answer.

**A**: You can find other versions, like older versions or modified versions in the Builds folder in this GitHub repository.

**A**: Yes, you can. You can also put a link to the datapack in the video description, that would be a great way to support me!

**A**: Yes, it does! It is confirmed to work with up to 1.20.2 and possibly higher. I always try to keep it up to date.

**Q**: How do I change the time you get an item?

Please note that I most likely won't backport the datapack to older versions as it utilises a lot of 1.16+ features and porting them into an older version is really time consuming and would need a lot of modifications.
