The Random Item Giver Datapack was originally created by Phoenix SC. He is creating awesome datapacks and youtube videos, so go check him out.
This datapack is a continuation of his datapack maintained by me, Seeloewen aka Louis9. With his permission, I'm updating it to every major version of Minecraft and also some snapshots.
Credits to other small contributers can be found in CREDITS.txt inside of the datapack folders.
